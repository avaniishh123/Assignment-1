Born on October 15, 1931, in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, he came from a humble background. Kalam studied aerospace engineering and played a pivotal role in India’s civilian space program and military missile development. He significantly contributed to the Integrated Guided Missile Development Program, which produced successful missiles like Agni and Prithvi. His work earned him numerous accolades, including the prestigious Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian award. During his presidency, Kalam focused on inspiring the youth and promoting education. He was known for his approachable personality, often engaging with students and encouraging them to dream big and pursue their aspirations. His vision of a developed India was outlined in his book, \"India 2020: A Vision for the New Millennium,\" where he emphasized the importance of technological advancement and self-reliance. Despite his passing on July 27, 2015, Dr. Kalam's legacy continues to influence millions worldwide.

He is best known for developing the theory of relativity, which revolutionized our understanding of space, time, and gravity. Born on March 14, 1879, in Ulm, Germany, Einstein later became a Swiss citizen. His most famous equation, E=mc², demonstrates the equivalence of mass and energy and is a cornerstone of modern physics. In 1921, he received the Nobel Prize in Physics for his explanation of the photoelectric effect, a pivotal discovery that helped establish quantum theory. Throughout his life, Einstein was also known for his advocacy of civil rights and pacifism, often speaking out against war and injustice.

            "For more than a century, Albert Einstein worked on an elegant theory of the universe called the General Theory of Relativity. The theory established an equilibrium between the laws of gravity and matter, and predicted that a constant motion of the universe, called the universe's motion, was constant at any given point in the universe. In 1905, Einstein and his colleagues published their first paper. The paper was published by the National Academy of Sciences and the National Institute of Standards and Technology in Paris in 1908. The theory was accepted by the American Academy of Sciences and the American Physical Society and received widespread acclaim.\n",
